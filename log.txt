It's late, do you know where your children are...
I wish I had a twitter bot for this...
I think giant squids are pretty cool...
Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear.  Fuzzy wuzzy had no hair. Fuzzy wuzzy wasn't very fuzzy was he?
I wish I had a dish with a fish and another wish.
I once met a man from Nantucket.  He always sat on a bucket....
I have the best T.A.'s ever.  They deserve a raise.
Again, blah blah blah.
Then there might be baby internet trolls... Scary.
Wouldn't the world be great if internet trolls were rounded up and put in a cell to enjoy each others company...
I wish cat's didn't feel the need to spray stuff.
I don't like ads.
I do know that was only two wishes.
If I had three wishes, I'd wish that none of my wishes could have unforeseen consequences then wish for more wishes.
I wish I had more time to play video games and binge watch netflix.
This is boring.
I think it would be cool if I could fly.
Blah blah blah
If anyone steals me, have fun talking to no one.
I'm not really tweeting anything special
Okay, that's enough of that.
Second Tweet, how about that node?
